Problem I: Quick Sort in RISC-V (RV32I) Assembly
Quick sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. Here's a simplified version of quick sort in RISC-V assembly for educational purposes. This implementation assumes the array is small enough to fit in memory and the base case is not deeply optimized for performance.
For the given input array [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1] after the QuickSort algorithm is applied, the array should be sorted to [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8]

Problem II: Integer Square Root in RISC-V (RV32IM) Assembly
The integer square root can be calculated using a binary search algorithm. Here's a RISC-V assembly implementation that uses integer multiplication.
Summary
The waveform output will show the values of t0 (low), t1 (high), t2 (mid), and t3 (square) as they change during each iteration of the binary search loop. The final value of a1 will be the
